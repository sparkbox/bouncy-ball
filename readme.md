This project compares web animation techniques by recreating a simple animation (a bouncing ball) with each one. It's kind of like TodoMVC, but for web animation.

This repository is two things:

  1. A **[directory](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/tree/gh-pages/examples)** containing examples and documentation for each animation technique.
  2. A **[demo site](http://sparkbox.github.io/bouncy-ball/)** where you can see the animations and read the source code required to create each one.

## Project Goals

  1. **Curate** the most popular and common web-animation techniques.
  2. **Compare** the techniques interactively.
  3. **Educate** developers with basic information for each technique.

### Performance

This project does not attempt to compare the performance of these animation approaches. If you are interested in a comparison like this, consider using a FPS bookmarklet, like [this one from stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/#bookmarklet).
