# Vanilla JS

Uses only Javascript and DOM APIs. No external libraries.

This technique uses a mathematic function to determine the position of the ball over time, and repeatedly draws the position on the screen using `requestAnimationFrame`.

Our function is a quadratic function in vertex form. It uses a modulus operator to make it discontinuous, matching the path of the ball.
