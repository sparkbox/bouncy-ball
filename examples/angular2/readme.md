# Angular 2
Angular 2 is the next version of Googleâ€™s massively popular MV* framework for building complex applications in the browser (and beyond).

This example uses setTimeout() within a recursive function to update a data-bound input property which ensures the animation occurs repeatedly.

This example uses the easing functionality built into Angular 2 which has all the fluid motion of animatronics from the 1950's.  This leaves a great deal of room for improvement.
