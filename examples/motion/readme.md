# Motion

Motion is a modern animation library, built on the Web Animations API.

Motion was developed by Matt Perry, based on his experiences building Popmotion (which simplified web animation before the Web Animations API existed) and Framer Motion (which became the most popular animation library in the ReactJS community). Motion is considered the successor to Framer Motion, offering support for both React and VanillaJS use-cases.
