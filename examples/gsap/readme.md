# GSAP

GSAP (the GreenSock Application Platform) is a suite of tools for creating "high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web." GSAP core can be used for common animation scenarios, while plugins are provided for scroll-based animations, draggable elements, and other use-cases.

Some business uses of GSAP may require you to [purchase a commercial license](https://gsap.com/licensing/).
