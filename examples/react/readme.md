# React
React.js is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and then compose them to make complex UIs.

React provides several methods of animations and transitions. Libraries like [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) allow realistic spring animations, and it is easy to use several popular animation libraries like [Velocity](https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react) or [GreenSock](https://github.com/azazdeaz/react-gsap-enhancer) directly.

This example simply borrows the animation function from the [VanillaJS example](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/blob/master/examples/vanilla-js/script.js) to update the ball's CSS values using javascript.
