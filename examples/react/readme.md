# React
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to build functionality as stateful components and compose them to make complex UIs.

React provides several methods of animations and transitions. Dedicated libraries like [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) provide animation with React conventions, but you can also use web-platform features to animate within React (with the right techniques).

This example uses the animation function from the [VanillaJS example](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/blob/master/examples/vanilla-js/script.js) to repeatedly render the component and update the ball's CSS values.
