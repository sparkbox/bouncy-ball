# WebGPU

WebGPU is a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins using more modern GPU API patterns, as well as using GPUs for acceleration of non-graphical operations through compute shaders. It is a successor to WebGL.

WebGPU programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is written in WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL), a language similar to Rust, and is executed on a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU). WebGPU is designed and maintained by the W3C.
