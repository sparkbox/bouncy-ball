# jQuery

jQuery, the popular DOM interaction library, includes many [effects](https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/), like the `.animate()` method we use in this demo.

The demo defines two animations, one for falling and one for rising, and sets them up with callbacks to trigger each other.

jQuery comes with a few simple easings, but more complex ones (like those in our demo) must be provided by an external library. Our demo uses 'easeInQuad' and 'easeOutQuad' which are provided by [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/easing/).
